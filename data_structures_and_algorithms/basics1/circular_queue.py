A circular queue is the extended version of a regular queue where the last element is
 connected to the first element. Thus forming a circle-like structure.

The circular queue solves the major limitation of the normal queue. In a normal queue, 
after a bit of insertion and deletion, there will be non-usable empty space.

Circular Queue Operations
The circular queue work as follows:

two pointers FRONT and REAR
FRONT track the first element of the queue
REAR track the last elements of the queue
initially, set value of FRONT and REAR to -1

1. Enqueue Operation
check if the queue is full
for the first element, set value of FRONT to 0
circularly increase the REAR index by 1 (i.e. if the rear reaches the end, next it would be at
 the start of the queue)
add the new element in the position pointed to by REAR

2. Dequeue Operation
check if the queue is empty
return the value pointed by FRONT
circularly increase the FRONT index by 1
for the last element, reset the values of FRONT and REAR to -1
However, the check for full queue has a new additional case:

Case 1: FRONT = 0 && REAR == SIZE - 1
Case 2: FRONT = REAR + 1
The second case happens when REAR starts from 0 due to circular increment and when its
 value is just 1 less than FRONT, the queue is full.

The complexity of the enqueue and dequeue operations of a circular queue is O(1) for 
(array implementations).
